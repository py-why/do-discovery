        "\n\n# Order-based algorithms for causal discovery from observational data without latent confounders\n\nWe will simulate some observational data from a Structural Causal Model (SCM) and\ndemonstrate how we will use the SCORE algorithm. The example can be easily adapted\nto CAM, DAS and  NoGAM methods.\n\nCAM, SCORE, DAS, NoGAM algorithms perform causal discovery in a two steps procedure.\nGiven observational i.i.d. data from an Additive Noise Model without\nlatent confounders, first the method estimates a topological ordering of the causal variables.\nThis partial ordering can be represented as a fully connected graph, where every node has an\nincoming edge from all its predecessors in the ordering. Second, the resulting fully connected\nDAG is pruned by some variable selection procedure.\nNote that knowing the topological ordering is already sufficient for estimating causal effects.\nNevertheless, the pruning step is justified by the fact that operating with a sparser graph is\nstatistically more efficient.\n\nThe four methods differ as follow:\n\n* In CAM algorithm the topological ordering is inferred by finding the permutation of the graph\n  nodes corresponding to the fully connected graph that maximizes the log-likelihood of the data.\n  After inference of the topological ordering, the pruning step is done by variable selection with\n  regression. In particular, for each variable ``j`` CAM fits a generalized additive model using as\n  covariates all the predecessor of ``j`` in the ordering, and performs hypothesis testing to select\n  relevant parent variables.\n* SCORE provides a more efficient topological ordering than CAM, while it inherits the pruning\n  procedure. In order to infer the topological ordering, SCORE estimates the Hessian matrix of the\n  log-likelihood. Then, it finds a leaf (i.e. a node without children) by taking the ``argmin`` of\n  the variance over the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix. Once a leaf is found, it is\n  removed from the graph and the procedure is iteratively repeated, evantually assigning a position\n  to each node.\n* DAS provides a more efficient pruning step, while it inherits the ordering method from SCORE.\n  Let ``H`` be the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood: given a leaf node ``j``, DAS selects an\n  edge ``i -> j`` if the pair satisfies ``mean(abs(H[i, j])) = 0``. Vanishing mean is verified by\n  hypothesis testing. Finally, CAM-pruning is applied on the resulting sparse graph, in order to\n  further reduce the number of false positives in the inferred DAG. Sparsity ensures linear\n  computational complexity of this final pruning step. (DAS can be seen as an efficient version of\n  SCORE, with better scaling properties in the graph size.)\n* NoGAM introduces a topological ordering procedure that does not assume any distribution\n  of the noise terms, whereas CAM, SCORE and DAS all require the noise to be Gaussian.\n  The pruning of the graph is done via CAM procedure. In order to define the topological order,\n  NoGAM identifies one leaf at the time: first, for each node in the graph, it estimates the\n  residuals of the regression problem that predicts a variable ``j`` from all the remaining nodes\n  ``1, 2, .., j-1, j+1, .., |V|`` (with ``|V|`` the number of nodes). Then, NoGAM tries to estimate\n  each entry ``j`` of the vector of the gradient of log-likelihood using the residual of the\n  variable ``j`` as covariate: a leaf is found by selection of the ``argmin`` of the mean squared\n  error of the predictions.\n\n\n.. currentmodule:: dodiscover\n"

First it estimates the topological order of the nodes in the\ngraphs. This is done iteratively according to the following procedure:\n\n1. SCORE estimates the Hessian of the logarithm of $p(V)$,\n   with $p(V)$ the joint distribution of the nodes in the graph.\n2. Let `H := Hessian(log p(V))`. SCORE selects a leaf in the graph by finding\n   the diagonal term of H with minimum variance,\n   i.e. by computing `np.argmin(np.var(np.diag(H))`.\n3. SCORE removes the leaf from the graph, and repeats steps from 1. to 3.\n   iteratively up to the source nodes.\n\nGiven the inferred topological order, SCORE prunes the graph with all the\nedges admitted by such ordering, by doing sparse regression to choose the\nrelevant variables. Variable selection is done by thresholding on the\np-values of the coefficients associated to the potential parents of a node.\nFor instance, consider a graph $G$ with 3 vertices $V = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. For\nsimplicity let the topological order be trivial, i.e. $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The unique\nfully connected adjacency matrix compatible with such ordering is the upper\ntriangular matrix `np.triu(np.ones((3, 3)), k=1)` with all ones above the\ndiagonal.\n\n"
