Causal discovery with interventional data - Sachs dataset
=========================================================

We will analyze the Sachs dataset :footcite:`sachsdataset2005` and reproduce analyses
from the Supplemental Figure 8 in :footcite:`Jaber2020causal` demonstrating the
usage of the :class:`dodiscover.constraint.PsiFCI` algorithm for learning causal graphs
from observational and/or interventional data.

The Sachs dataset is a famous dataset in causal discovery because of its real-life
applicability and access to experimental data that analyzed the causal network of
protein signaling pathways. We will analyze the preprocessed interventional dataset,
which we download using the package `pooch <https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/>`_.
The preprocessed dataset consists of categorical features, so we will use the
:class:`dodiscover.ci.GSquareCITest` for testing conditional independence and
invariances of the conditional distributions across experimental conditions.
There are a total of 6 experimental conditions represented by the ``INT`` column.

# Pull in the Sachs Dataset
# -------------------------
# The Sachs dataset is a famous dataset in causal discovery because of its real-life
# applicability and access to experimental data that analyzed the causal network of
# 11 proteins using knockouts and spikings :footcite:`sachsdataset2005`. The pathways
# for those proteins are already known, so it is an ideal dataset for benchmarking
# causal discovery algorithms.
#
# We will download a preprocessed version of the dataset from the following
# url: https://www.bnlearn.com/book-crc/code/sachs.interventional.txt.gz

# Preprocess the dataset
# ----------------------

# that is acceptable by dodiscover's :class:`constraint.PsiFCI` algorithm. We
# will form a list of separate dataframes.

# Setup constraint-based learner
# ------------------------------
# Since we have access to interventional data, the causal discovery algorithm
# we will use that leverages CI and CD tests to estimate causal constraints
# is the Psi-FCI algorithm :footcite:`Jaber2020causal`.

# Our dataset is comprised of discrete valued data, so we will utilize the
# G^2 (Chi-square) CI test.

# Since our data is entirely discrete, we can also use the G^2 test as our
# CD test.

# Run the learning process
# ------------------------
# We have setup our causal context and causal discovery learner, so we will now

# `fit` design. All fitted attributes contain an underscore at the end.

# %%
# Analyze the results
# ===================
# Now that we have learned the graph, we will show it here. Note differences and similarities
# to the ground-truth DAG that is "assumed". Moreover, note that this reproduces Supplementary
# Figure 8 in :footcite:`Jaber2020causal`.

# Interpretation
# --------------
# Looking at the supplemental figure 8b in :footcite:`Jaber2020causal`, we see that the
# learned PAG matches quite well.
