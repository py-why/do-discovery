# dodiscover

DoDiscover is a Python library for causal discovery (causal structure learning). If one does not have access to a causal graph for their modeling problem, they may use DoDiscover to learn causal structure from their data (e.g., in the form of a graph).

# What makes dodiscovery different from other causal discovery libraries?

Why do we need another causal discovery library?
Here are some design goals that differentiate DoDiscover from other causal discovery libraries.

## Ease of use

An analyst should be able to get a causal discovery workflow working quickly without intimate knowledge of causal discovery algorithms.
DoDiscover prioritizes the workflow over the algorithms and provides default arguments to algorithm parameters.

## Democratizing deep causal discovery

Many cutting-edge causal discovery algorithms rely on deep learning frameworks.
However, deep learning-based causal discovery often requires obscure boilerplate code, complex configuration, and management of large artifacts such as embeddings.
DoDiscover seeks to create abstractions that address these challenges and make deep causal discovery more broadly accessible. Current algorithms are a work-in-progress. We will begin by providing a robust API for the fundamental discovery algorithms.

## Easy interface for articulating causal assumptions

Domain experts bring a large amount of domain knowledge to a problem.
That domain knowledge can establish causal assumptions that can constrain causal discovery.
Causal discovery (indeed, all causal inferences) requires causal assumptions.

However, a newly developed causal discovery algorithm has a greater research impact when it can do more with fewer assumptions.
This "do more with less" orientation tends to deemphasize assumptions in the user interfaces of many causal discovery libraries.

DoDiscover prioritizes the interface for causal assumptions.
Further, DoDiscover seeks to help the user feel confident with their assumptions by emphasizing testing assumptions, making inferences under uncertainty, and robustness to model misspecification.

## Unite causal discovery and causal representation learning

Causal representation learning is the task of learning high-level latent variables and the causal structure between them from low-level variables observed in data.
DoDiscover seeks to support causal representation learning algorithms in the context of traditional causal discovery settings.

# Documentation

See the [development version documentation](https://py-why.github.io/dodiscover/dev/index.html).

Or see [stable version documentation](https://py-why.github.io/dodiscover/stable/index.html)

# Installation

Installation is best done via `pip` or `conda`. For developers, they can also install from source using `pip`. See [installation page](TBD) for full details.

## Dependencies

Minimally, dodiscover requires:

    * Python (>=3.8)
    * numpy
    * scipy
    * networkx
    * pandas

For explicit graph functionality for representing various causal graphs, such as ADMG, or CPDAGs, you will also need:

    * pywhy-graphs
    * graphs  # this is a development version for PRable MixedEdgeGraph to networkx

For explicitly representing causal graphs, we recommend using `pywhy-graphs` package, but if you have a graph library that adheres to the graph protocols we require, then you can in principle use those graphs.

## User Installation

If you already have a working installation of numpy, scipy and networkx, the easiest way to install dodiscover is using `pip`:

    # doesn't work until we make an official release :p
    pip install -U dodiscover

To install the package from github, clone the repository and then `cd` into the directory. You can then use `poetry` to install:

    poetry install

    # for graph functionality
    poetry install --extras graph_func

    # to load datasets used in tutorials
    poetry install --extras data

    # if you would like an editable install of dodiscover for dev purposes
    pip install -e .
