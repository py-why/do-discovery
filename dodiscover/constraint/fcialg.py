    """The Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm for causal discovery.

    A complete constraint-based causal discovery algorithm that
    operates on observational data :footcite:`Zhang2008` assuming there
    may exist latent confounders, and optionally selection bias.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ci_estimator : Callable
        The conditional independence test function. The arguments of the estimator should
        be data, node, node to compare, conditioning set of nodes, and any additional
        keyword arguments.
    alpha : float, optional
        The significance level for the conditional independence test, by default 0.05.
    min_cond_set_size : int, optional
        Minimum size of the conditioning set, by default None, which will be set to '0'.
        Used to constrain the computation spent on the algorithm.
    max_cond_set_size : int, optional
        Maximum size of the conditioning set, by default None. Used to limit
        the computation spent on the algorithm.
    max_combinations : int, optional
        The maximum number of conditional independence tests to run from the set
        of possible conditioning sets. By default None, which means the algorithm will
        check all possible conditioning sets. If ``max_combinations=n`` is set, then
        for every conditioning set size, 'p', there will be at most 'n' CI tests run
        before the conditioning set size 'p' is incremented. For controlling the size
        of 'p', see ``min_cond_set_size`` and ``max_cond_set_size``. This can be used
        in conjunction with ``keep_sorted`` parameter to only test the "strongest"
        dependences.
    skeleton_method : SkeletonMethods
        The method to use for testing conditional independence. Must be one of
        ('neighbors', 'complete', 'neighbors_path'). See Notes for more details.
    apply_orientations : bool
        Whether or not to apply orientation rules given the learned skeleton graph
        and separating set per pair of variables. If ``True`` (default), will
        apply Zhang's orientation rules R0-10, orienting colliders and certain
        arrowheads and tails :footcite:`Zhang2008`.
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of iterations through the graph to apply
        orientation rules.
    max_path_length : int, optional
        The maximum length of any discriminating path, or None if unlimited.
    selection_bias : bool
        Whether or not to account for selection bias within the causal PAG.
        See :footcite:`Zhang2008`.
    pds_skeleton_method : SkeletonMethods
        The method to use for learning the skeleton using PDS. Must be one of
        ('pds', 'pds_path'). See Notes for more details.
    ci_estimator_kwargs : dict
        Keyword arguments for the ``ci_estimator`` function.

    References

    Notes
    -----
    Note that the algorithm is called "fast causal inference", but in reality
    the algorithm is quite expensive in terms of the number of conditional
    independence tests it must run.
