Conditional Independence Testing
================================

Testing for conditional independence among variables is a core part
of many causal inference procedures, such as constraint-based structure
learning.

Context for causal discovery
============================

Rather than just data, in many cases structure learning
has additional "context", in the form of apriori knowledge of
the structure, or additional datasets from different environments.
All structure learning algorithms in ``dodiscover`` pass in a ``Context``
object rather than just data. See docs for ``Context`` for more information.
