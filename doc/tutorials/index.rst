Basic causal discovery models without latent confounders
========================================================
The first tutorial presents several algorithms for causal discovery without latent confounding: the Peters and Clarke (PC) algorithm. 
These models provide a basis for learning causal structure from data when we make the **assumption** that there are
no latent confounders.
